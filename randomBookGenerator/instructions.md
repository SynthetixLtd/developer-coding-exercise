# Synthetix Competency Task

## Instructions
You should be able to view the project by visiting my domain: joelmashana.co.uk

## Why
I enjoy reading but noticed that I keep reading similar books around similar topics. I get most of my book reccomendations from friends, family, social media, and podcasts and intervies that I watch. Therefore I never truly get to read anything which is out of the ordinary for me.

I created this app because I wanted a way to ensure that every now and then I can read a book I otherwise would have never read and also to keep track of the books I am reading.

## Data

The web app fetches data from the google books api by category

## Program flow
User selects their prefered category
Random book is displayed from that category
User clicks Add new book to reveal the form.
On submit, book is added to the db.
