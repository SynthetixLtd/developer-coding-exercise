# Synthetix Competency Task

## Instructions
You should be able to view the project by visiting my domain: joelmashana.co.uk

## Why
I enjoy reading but noticed that I keep reading similar books around similar topics. I get most of my book recomendations from friends, family, social media, and podcasts and interviews that I watch. Therefore I never truly get to read anything which is out of the ordinary for me. 

I created this app because I wanted a way to ensure that every now and then I can read a book I otherwise would have never read and also to keep track of the books I am reading.

## Data

The web app fetches data from the google books api by category.

## Program flow
When instance created method runs which runs ajax call to viewAll.php.
User selects their prefered category.
Ajax call to php routine to fetch google book data.
User clicks Add new book to reveal the form.
On form submit, php routine runs which adds entry to db.
