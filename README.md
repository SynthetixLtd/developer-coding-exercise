## Coding exercise

We'd like you to use the API documentation on [api.synthetix.com](https://api.synthetix.com/) and the [external](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/398068/S17uunUa#6290f043-6982-4f8e-988b-9e9f64c073f3 "external") resources to make a very simple application based around it showcasing all of below technologies:

1.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Extra points for Vue.js, React, or Angular2)
2.  Programming languages (PHP, Node.JS)
3.  Databases (Relational & Non-Relational)
4.  Version control (Git)
5.  Deployment and hosting (any cloud provider - extra points for AWS and automated deployment)

Please feel free to select any of the above platforms that you are most comfortable with, if you are not comfortable with the technologies listed, please speak to your Synthetix contact to see if you are able to use an alternative.

Once you have completed the exercise either email us a link to your forked repo or create a pull request to this repository. Please don’t include any  `node_modules`  folders, we'll regenerate dependencies as part running the code.

If we can’t figure out how to get your application running, it’s been a waste of your time, so please include any instructions we might need to launch it in the `instructions.md` file.

If you are hosting the code yourself please also provide us with a link or instructions on how to access it.

## Considerations
Please take the following into the consideration as much as you can while developing the solution:

- Simplicity
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Performance
- Usability
- Code quality
- Design patterns and best practices

Please ask any questions you may have of your Synthetix contact. This is not a test of your ability to understand our written instructions, it really is just an opportunity to write some code.
